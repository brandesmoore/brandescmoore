A look into burials in the Nashville City Cemetery

# THE DATA
The Nashville City Cemetery provided a dataset of known burials
 from 1846 through 1979. The dataset held factual information, including
the sex, race, class and cause of death of those buried in the cemetery. Some additional information included a glimpse
into historical trends in medicine, literacy and racial inequality.

# THE ASK
The Nashville City Cemetery Association asked the NSS Tourism Agency to explore the dataset in order to create charts to be used as marketing materials for a new Peddle Tavern route. The new route is scheduled to run during the Halloween season.  

# MY PROCESS
This was an individual project where I used my advanced Excel skills to clean the data, create VLOOKUPs, UNIQUE values, pivot tables, slicers, categorical distributions and  various visualizations to examine the following:

1. 10 most common (known) recorded causes of death
2. Number of burials per year
    
    * What years had the most burials?
    * What caused the increase in burials during these years?
3. Examine burials by decade

    * What's the total number of burials?
    * How have the proportion of male:female deaths changed by decade?

4. How has Age at the time of burial changed over time?

    * Based on categorical Age groups, what's the avg Age at burial?
    * What proportion of burials consisted of infants or centennials?

5. What were the Top 5 Causes of burials per month?

    * Were there months with higher burials than others?
    * Would you have likely died in your birthday month?

6. What are the Top 10 most common Last Names among the burials?

    * What historic Nashville person is buried in the cememtery?
    * What was their cause of death?
7. Are there any patterns regarding where people are buried?
    * Look at class and race differences by `Section/Lot`.


# TAKEAWAYS
*Challenges*

(Cleaning) 
The dataset contained over 2,000 burial causes that contained mispellings that had to be cleaned in order to gather an accurate account of the burial causes. This was the most challenging task of this project, but once the data was scraped, I was able to manipulate it to show the visualizations I wanted. 

(Dashboard)
There was so much I wanted to add to my dashboard to present to the Nashville City Cememtery Association, but I was limited to one page.

*Rewards*

Prior to this project, I'd only used Excel for mathematical calculations related to profit and loss statements, project tracking and budgets. Utilizing the Nashville City Cemetery data allowed me to apply my love for color and history into a working piece of art that highlighted:
